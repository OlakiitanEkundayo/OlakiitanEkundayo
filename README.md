# Hi, I'm Olakiitan 👋

Backend developer specializing in API integrations and automation for eCommerce stores. I help mid-sized Shopify and WooCommerce sellers ($200k-5M/year revenue) eliminate manual drudgery—like endless inventory checks and order processing—that costs them 10-20 hours/week and $3k-8k/month in overselling losses.

My focus: Building robust Laravel backends that connect Shopify APIs, handle webhooks for real-time updates, and queue jobs to automate repetitive tasks. Future-proofing with AI integrations for smarter ops.

### What I'm Building Right Now
- **Shopify Product Fetcher**: A Laravel tool that pulls product data (titles, variants, inventory) via REST API, with pagination and error handling. Foundation for automated inventory alerts—saving stores from manual exports.
- **Inventory Alert System**: Uses webhooks and background queues to notify when stock dips low, preventing oversells in multi-channel setups.
- **Multi-Channel Inventory Sync**: Showcase project syncing Shopify data with other platforms, cutting data entry time by hours.


### Tech Stack & Skills
- **Core**: Laravel (PHP), MySQL, RESTful APIs, OAuth authentication
- **eCommerce Focus**: Shopify API, webhooks, background jobs/queues
- **Upcoming**: OpenAI API for AI-enhanced features (e.g., auto-generated product insights)
- **Principles**: Pain-solving over labels—clients buy solutions to overselling and manual work, not "backend dev" titles.

### Why Work With Me?
I dive deep into eCommerce pains: Multi-channel syncs, order automation, and ROI-driven features. My edge? Business mindset + technical precision—tools that directly reclaim time and protect revenue.
